# TailwindCss / PostCSS / Grunt minimal example

A spike for my own benefit to figure out how the pieces fit together ready for use in a sailsjs project.

Run it with

```
asdf install
npm install
grunt
```

or something like that.

## The commits show the the following build up

1. Empty repo
1. nodejs version with asdf-vm
1. Basic postcss processing
1. Add tailwindcss and process it
1. Add grunt, process unrelated file
1. Configure grunt to run postcss, which in turn builds the tailwindcss
